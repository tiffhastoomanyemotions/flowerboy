      eyes rise open<br>
      <br>
      to the amber reaches<br>
      of morning sun<br>
      <br>
      and spheres of obsidian<br>
      become twin pools<br>
      <br>
      of golden, stickysweet<br>
      honey<br>

      <br>
      a girl with golden skin and onyx hair<br>
      a tattered inky kimono pooling around her waist<br>
      she’s sitting one knee up, guarding a viny torii<br>
      a sheathed katana beside her ground-tapping fingers<br>
      <br>
      a boy with baby soft skin and ruby red lips, kohl around his eyes<br>
      worn out boots caressing baby feet, black cap shading rosy cheeks<br>
      cross-legged, he’s comfortable among the flowers and the stems<br>
      look, the ferns are hugging him, whispering “be my friend”<br>
      <br>
      a white-haired, white-skinned, wide-eyed moonchild<br>
      never worn anything but plain white t shirt, jeans, and sneakers<br>
      his tilted chin rests on gentle palms, crossed ankles on roof tiles<br>
      he looks at you—through you—he only has eyes for the stars<br>
      <br>
      a city kid, living fast, smog in his lungs and culture in his veins<br>
      a glowing silver watch under dull gray sleeves to keep track of the trains, two a day<br>
      his sleepy eyes and smiling lips rest atop a dusty backpack<br>
      he will forever belong to the painted concrete, rumbling and bright<br>
      <br>
      a cotton candy girl living only in a bubblegum world<br>
      hair gathered in pigtails, wearing pink everything pink<br>
      she’s got her leg flicked back and her palms flat down like a princess<br>
      smile so big she can’t see any of your negativity<br>
      <br>
      a pale scrawny boy, freckles tracing constellations on his cheeks<br>
      big round glasses indent his nose and he’s still wearing his school uniform<br>
      sitting at an old walnut desk, protected by his castle of books<br>
      what’s he writing back there? perhaps this very scrawl<br>
      <br>

    <div class="poem">
      if you strained your eyes<br>
      against the lens of the Hubble<br>
      <br>
      perhaps you’d be able to gaze<br>
      upon the blueshift of the planets.<br>
      <br>
      just like pluto’s tendency toward blue<br>
      as it finds itself hurtling at neptune,<br>
      <br>
      the castles around my bed<br>
      and the cicatrices in my flesh<br>
      <br>
      are tinged blue<br>
      from my failed endeavors out of loneliness.<br>
      <br>
      i think that if you instead closed your eyes<br>
      and listened with all your heart<br>
      <br>
      you’d be able to hear, maybe even feel,<br>
      the blueshift of humans.<br>

    <div class="poem">
      i might as well have burned their pages<br>
      <br>
      buying paper terrariums<br>
      of ink and universes,<br>
      <br>
      leaving them on a ledge<br>
      to grow dust instead of thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      if you ask me why they sit <br>
      instead of flip,<br>
      <br>
      i’d tell you it’s the watch’s fault<br>
      for swinging hands too fast.<br>
      <br>
      really, it’s just that time flies <br>
      when you neglect to lock its cage.<br>

    <div class="poem">
      i pulled the legs from a tree frog<br>
      to see if, against the world, it would keep dancing.<br>
      <br>
      some part of me was satisfied that<br>
      at least death returns all to correctness.<br>
      <br>
      the other part knew that i had condemned a tree frog <br>
      to pavement because i wanted to be it.<br>
