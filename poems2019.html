      i drove in the right lane,<br>
      letting every car pass us by,<br>
      never changing lanes to get ahead,<br>
      never impatient,<br>
      because i hoped that somehow time<br>
      would be lenient,<br>
      would drag the brakes a few miles,<br>
      and i could have more time.<br>

      i feel like<br>
      im sitting on a rooftop<br>
      in the middle of the night<br>
      but the building is burning around me<br>
      and there are tears falling down my face<br>
      but its okay<br>
      because im folding paper cranes<br>
      and im next to someone i love<br>
      and the way they press their body into mine<br>
      reminds me that im alive<br>

    <div class="poem">
      there was once a time,<br>
      a few windings of the watch ago,<br>
      that i wanted to save the world.<br>
      <br>
      and then i learned that the world is not my playground,<br>
      but rather the corroding ticking gears of a political bureaucracy<br>
      i’d rather not touch.<br>
      <br>
      i’d rather save my world.<br>
      save the fun and entertainment, bubbling from my eyes.<br>
      save the nihilistic mischief, grinning from heart to lungs.<br>
      <br>
      i live for the tears of thought.<br>
      i live for the soft aesthetic.<br>
      i live for the dying apple, bleeding through and through.<br>

      i almost crashed my car cloud-gazing<br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      two whales<br>
      swimming side by side in the clouds<br>
      were beautifully, perfectly, captivatingly “human.”<br>
      <br>
      the visual of compartmentalized multifacetedness<br>
      and the ever-shifting space-time<br>
      that rarely offsets the wind’s intentions.<br>
      <br>
      i saw in them the bitter balance between<br>
      being unapologetically yourself,<br>
      and being loved.<br>

      i’d fall for me like rain on pavement.<br>
      i’d wait for me until the 5am.<br>
      <br>
      we spend so much time <br>
      looking for someone to love<br>
      <br>
      that we forget the ones we should love the most<br>
      are ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      so plug the stars back in,<br>
      wipe the clouds from the roof,<br>
      <br>
      let’s watch the moonflowers bloom<br>
      until our dreams bid farewell.<br>

    <div class="poem">
      i think the music you listen to<br>
      says a lot about who you are.<br>
      <br>
      when i was 10 years old,<br>
      i flipped through radio stations<br>
      until i found a ballad.<br>
      because ballads were sad<br>
      and so was i.<br>
      that was the year<br>
      i started crying myself to sleep.<br>
      <br>
      when i was 13 years old,<br>
      i scrolled through youtube<br>
      until i found millennium.<br>
      because dancey edm was electric<br>
      and i wanted to feel something other than numb.<br>
      that was the year<br>
      i started hurting myself.<br>
      <br>
      now i’m seventeen.<br>
      i hit shuffle on my spotify<br>
      not caring which song plays.<br>
      because all of it is k-<br>
      reminding me that it's okay to be happy.<br>
      this is the year<br>
      i finally learn to love who i am.<br>
